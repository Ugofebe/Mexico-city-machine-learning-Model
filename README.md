## Housing Price Prediction in Mexico City
This project aims to predict housing prices in Mexico City using machine learning models. The main models used in this project are Ridge and Linear Regression, implemented using the scikit-learn library. Additionally, the data preprocessing steps involve one-hot encoding categorical features and imputing missing values using SimpleImputer.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to housing properties in Mexico City, such as location, size, amenities, and more. The target variable is the price of the properties.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to understand the data preprocessing and modeling steps.
Experiment with different parameters and models to improve the prediction accuracy.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
seaborn for data visualization
matplotlib for visualization
